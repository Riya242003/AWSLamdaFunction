# AWSLamdaFunction
The Lambda function is triggered when a user submits a contact form on a website. It takes the form data (e.g., name, email, message) and stores it in a DynamoDB table for future retrieval or analysis. This setup is commonly used in serverless architectures to handle lightweight and scalable data storage.
